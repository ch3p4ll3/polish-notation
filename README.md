# polish-notation
Polish notation is a mathematical notation in which operators precede their operands, in contrast to the more common infix notation, in which operators are placed between operands, as well as reverse Polish notation, in which operators follow their operands. It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands.
